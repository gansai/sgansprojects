MERCIFUL MENTORS,
Iam a last moment guy.
I thought I could manage to do some thing at last.
Atlast that belief failed me now.

To be short,
the code submitted is incomplete.
And it is your wish to give comments on the code.

The basic idea behind my code is as follows:
Start at a node A.
Take the distance measure with all other nodes.
Let next node B in the path be the node having minimum distance measure.
From node B again compute the distance measure with remaining nodes.
Now we will get a path having minimum distance cost having started at node A.

Now do the same thing starting at all nodes and then find the minimum of all minimum
And we will arrive at the path having the leaqst cost.

This is a greedy approach.

I am open to comments.
Thanking you for opportunity.
